Pseudocode

Pseudocode is not actual code; instead, it is a detailed yet informal description of what a computer program or algorithm must do. It is intended for human reading rather than machine reading.
Therefore, it is easier for people to understand than conventional programming language code. Pseudocode does not need to obey any specific syntax rules, unlike conventional programming languages.
Hence, it can be understood by any programmer, irrespective of the programming languages theyâ€™re familiar with.

As a programmer, pseudocode will help you better understand how to implement an algorithm, especially if it is unfamiliar to you. You can then translate your pseudocode into your chosen programming language.
